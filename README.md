1.Connect the LCD module: 

RS to Digital Pin 7 

EN to Digital Pin 8 

D4 to Digital Pin 9 

D5 to Digital Pin 10 

D6 to Digital Pin 11 

D7 to Digital Pin 12 

VSS to GND 

VDD to 5V 

VO to 1k resistor to GND 

RW to GND 

A (Backlight +) to 5V 

K (Backlight -) to GND 

2.Connect the RGB LED (Common Cathode):
